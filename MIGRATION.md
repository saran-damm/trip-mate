# Backend to Firebase Migration

This document outlines the changes made to migrate the Trip Planner application from a separate backend server to Firebase.

## Migration Overview

The application has been migrated from a Python FastAPI backend to Firebase services. This simplifies the architecture by allowing direct interaction with Firebase from the frontend using TypeScript.

## Key Changes

### 1. Firebase Setup

- Added Firebase dependencies
- Created Firebase configuration file (`src/firebase/config.ts`)
- Set up environment variables for Firebase configuration

### 2. Authentication

- Migrated from custom backend authentication to Firebase Authentication
- Updated `AuthContext` and `useAuth` hook to use Firebase Authentication
- Implemented user registration, login, logout, and password reset using Firebase

### 3. Data Storage

- Migrated from backend API endpoints to Firestore Database
- Created Firebase service for trending destinations
- Implemented data seeding for initial application data

### 4. API Integration

- Created `useFirebase` hook to replace the previous `useAPI` hook
- Updated components to use Firebase services directly
- Removed backend API calls and replaced with Firebase SDK calls

### 5. Initialization

- Added Firebase initialization logic
- Created `FirebaseInitializer` component to handle initialization state
- Implemented data seeding for first-time application setup

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Eliminated the need for a separate backend server
2. **Reduced Deployment Complexity**: Single deployment for the entire application
3. **Real-time Data**: Firebase provides real-time data synchronization
4. **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication provides secure user management
5. **Scalability**: Firebase automatically scales with application growth

## Future Improvements

1. **Offline Support**: Implement offline data persistence using Firebase
2. **Security Rules**: Define comprehensive Firestore security rules
3. **Cloud Functions**: Add serverless functions for complex operations
4. **Analytics**: Integrate Firebase Analytics for user behavior tracking
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Add Firebase Performance Monitoring
